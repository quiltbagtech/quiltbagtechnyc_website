Easily embed GitHub READMEs in pages/posts.

== Description ==

Github README is a plugin that allows you to embed markdown from GitHub in a page or post using a simple shortcode. 

Usage:

**github_readme**

This shortcode embeds the project's readme. 

[github_readme repo="octalmage/Marknote"]

You can also trim lines from the top of the readme using the "trim" option: 

[github_readme repo="octalmage/Marknote" trim="3"]

This is useful for removing titles since your page/post will most likely already have one. 

**github_markdown**

This shortcode embeds any markdown file found in the repository. 

[github_markdown repo="octalmage/Marknote" file="README.md"]

trim, branch, and cache (seconds to cache) also supported.

**github_wikipage**

This shortcode embeds pages from a project's wiki.

[github_wikipage repo="octalmage/Marknote" page="Syntax"]

trim and cache also supported.
